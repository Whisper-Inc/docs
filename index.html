                        <p>
                          Whisper is a lightweight messaging service designed
                          with scalability in mind above all else. We have built
                          Whisper with the intention of adding new features in
                          the future, but this documentation will cover the
                          basics of how we went from zero to a public MVP.

                    Jamie, the team lead, is responsible for defining the
                    project scope, delegating tasks, and maintaining overall
                    project direction. In addition to leadership duties, he
                    contributed to the project setup, configuration, and backend
                    development.

                  <h4>Syed Abbas: UI/UX & Backend Integration</h4>
                  <p>
                    Syed focused primarily on frontend development, working on
                    React-based UI components while also configuring API
                    endpoints to bridge frontend and backend functionality.

                    Contributing across both backend and frontend, Hysam
                    concentrated on the user authentication flow, including
                    login, registration and websocket functionality, ensuring
                    secure and instant access to the system.

                  <p>
                    Samuel worked mainly on backend logic and was instrumental
                    in implementing and running automated tests. This ensured
                    the stability of the codebase through unit and end-to-end
                    testing.

                  <p>
                    We used a GitHub scrum board to effectively delegate and
                    manage tasks across our team. Each sprint was organized into
                    clear milestones with tracked progress, ensuring alignment
                    and accountability.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    In Sprint 1, we focused on laying the foundation of the
                    project. This included setting up the monorepo, CI/CD
                    pipeline, database configuration and defining our tech stack
                    across core and client services.
                  </p>

                  />
                  <p>
                    During Sprint 2, we built out major features like
                    authentication, chat creation, and message handling. The
                    team worked across backend, frontend, and we added unit and
                    end-to-end tests to ensure the code was maintainable.
                  </p>

                  />
                  <p>
                    Sprint 3 focused on testing, bug fixes, and refining UX. We
                    also fully completed our documentation for future reference.
                  </p>

                    <li>
                      <strong>Task assignment:</strong> Delegated new tasks
                      based on availability, expertise, and interest, ensuring
                      balanced workloads.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Scrum board updates:</strong> Moved cards across
                      columns (To Do, In Progress, Done) and added new issues or

                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    These meetings promoted transparency, allowed for real-time

                  <p>
                    Our team emphasized the importance of code reviews as a key
                    part of our development workflow. Every pull request was
                    reviewed by at least two other team members before being
                    merged into the main branch. This not only helped catch bugs
                    early but also ensured consistency in code quality, style,
                    and design decisions across the project.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Code reviews provided a valuable opportunity for team
                    members to:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Share knowledge:</strong> Reviewing each other's
                      code helped everyone stay familiar with different parts of
                      the codebase.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Maintain consistency:</strong> We followed
                      agreed-upon conventions and design patterns, which were
                      reinforced during review.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Improve code quality:</strong> Suggestions and
                      feedback often led to better performance, readability, and
                      maintainability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <strong>Encourage collaboration:</strong> Discussions in
                      review threads fostered healthy team communication and
                      problem-solving.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <p>
                    We used GitHub's pull request system to manage reviews,
                    assign reviewers, and track changes. This workflow ensured
                    that all team members were engaged in each other's work and
                    contributed to the overall quality of the project.

                  <h4 id="line0_3">Design Choices</h4>
                  <h4>Whisper Inc Organisation - Our monorepository</h4>

                  <h5>Whisper Core</h5>
                  <p>
                    Whisper Core is the repository that houses the backend of
                    our service. It handles authentication, chat logic, data
                    storage, and API endpoints for client communication.
                  </p>

                  <h5>Whisper Client</h5>
                  <p>
                    Whisper Client is the frontend application used by users to
                    interact with the platform. Built with modern frameworks, it
                    provides real-time messaging with individuals and groups,
                    all while maintaining a modern and sleek user interface.
                  </p>

                  <h5>Docs</h5>
                  <p>
                    Docs is the documentation hub for Whisper Inc. It contains
                    developer guides, API references and architecture overviews
                    to help team members navigate the codebase.
                  </p>

                  <h4 id="line0_2">Why We Chose Python</h4>
                  <p>
                    We chose Python for our backend development due to its
                    simplicity, readability, and wide adoption in web
                    development. Python's vast ecosystem of libraries,
                    particularly for APIs and database management, allowed us to
                    move quickly and build a solid backend foundation. Its clean
                    syntax made collaboration between team members easy,
                    especially when developing or reviewing code.
                  </p>

                  <h4 id="line0_3">Why We Chose React</h4>
                  <p>
                    On the frontend, we selected React because of its
                    component-based architecture, responsive rendering, and
                    strong developer community. React allowed us to break down
                    the UI into reusable, maintainable components that made the
                    app easier to scale and test. Its seamless integration with
                    modern styling libraries and state management tools also
                    helped speed up development and enhance user experience.
                  </p>

                  <h4 id="line0_4">Why We Chose MongoDB</h4>
                  <p>
                    We selected MongoDB as our database solution due to its
                    developer-friendly features and seamless integration with
                    Python. The PyMongo API made it easy to interact with the
                    database using native Python syntax, which reduced
                    complexity and sped up backend development. Additionally,
                    MongoDB's lightweight, schema-less structure allowed us to
                    iterate on our data models quickly without worrying about
                    rigid table definitions. The clean and intuitive user
                    interface provided by MongoDB Atlas also made it easy to
                    visualize, manage, and debug data during development.
                  </p>

                  <h4 id="line0_5">Why We Chose FastAPI Over Flask</h4>
                  <p>
                    We chose FastAPI for our backend framework instead of Flask
                    primarily due to its built-in support for asynchronous
                    request handling, which enables better performance and
                    scalability. FastAPI’s use of modern Python features like
                    type hints and Pydantic models helped us write more robust,
                    self-validating code while improving code clarity and
                    autocompletion.

                  <p>
                    The primary stakeholders for this messaging service are
                    teenage students, mainly in school, who use the platform to

                  <p>
                    Model: Represents the user interface data—like messages,
                    chat history, user profiles, and settings. The model
                    contains the necessary information for display but doesn't
                    directly handle user actions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    View: The UI components that the user interacts with,chat
                    rooms, buttons, and settings. This layer is responsible for
                    rendering data to the user in a way that's easy to
                    understand.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Controller: The logic layer that processes user inputs, such
                    as sending messages, joining group chats, or updating
                    profiles. It communicates with the backend to fetch data or
                    send requests and updates the view accordingly.
                  </p>

                  <strong>Backend Mircoservice (MVC)</strong>
                  <p>
                    Model: Contains the business logic and data structure, such
                    as user authentication, message storage, and group chat
                    management. It manages interactions with the database.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    View: The API responses that the frontend receives from the
                    backend. These views are not directly presented to the user
                    but are the data structures (like JSON) that are returned to
                    the frontend for rendering.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Controller: The API controllers that handle incoming
                    requests from the frontend, such as creating accounts,
                    sending messages, or updating group chats. The controller
                    processes requests, interacts with the model (business
                    logic), and returns the necessary data (view) to the
                    frontend.
                  </p>

                    In order to make it simple to run locally, we have
                    abstracted the initial setup logic by creating a Dockerfile
                    for running our application on Docker.

                    With this implemented, you can simply run the following two
                    commands to spin up a local instance of the service:
                  </p>
                  <pre class="brush: bash">
                    docker compose build
                  </pre>
                  <pre class="brush: bash">
                    docker compose up
                  </pre>
                  <p>
                    This will bring up two containers; one for the FastAPI
                    application, and one for the MongoDB instance connection.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    This is a much better alternative to using a Python virtual
                    environment, as this would require manually installing
                    dependencies after each clone/fork, and by containerising
                    the application, we can easily deploy it in other locations.

                  As dicussed previously, for the user interface we as a group
                  have decided to use React Js with NextJs and Typescript. For
                  styling, we have decided to use TailwindCSS. I have taken the
                  role to be the main frontend developer in the group. To start
                  off, I looked at the designs ad user intefaces for other
                  messaging service applications such as Mircrosoft Teams. With
                  this, I was able to decide on the main components that I would
                  need to create for a foundational structure that can be built
                  on.
                </p>

                <h4 id="line4_2">Components for Basic Structure</h4>
                <p>
                  As we are following MVC, these are our main view components
                </p>

                <div class="row d-flex align-items-stretch text-center">
                  <!-- Sidebar -->
                  <div class="col-md-4 mb-4 d-flex">
                    <div class="card w-100 h-100">
                      <img
                        src="images/upload/sidebar.png"
                        class="card-img-top img-fluid"
                        alt="Sidebar"
                        style="height: 200px; object-fit: cover"

                          Having this as part of the basic structure is crucial,
                          as it will be the component that allows the users to
                          interact with the application and access different
                          pages such as settings or group chats. Therefore,
                          features will be built on top of this. After
                          discussing with the team, we have decided to only have
                          3 menus. Direct will allow users to access any priavte
                          chats they may have. Group chats will allow users to
                          access any other chats they may have with multiple
                          people. The settings menu will allow users to access
                          profile and notifications settings.

                          This component will allow users to access and their

                          functionality will be built on top, such as accesssing
                          specific chat messages and loading chats from API's.
                          Using the search bar at the top users will be able to
                          search for specific chats and filter the list
                          accordingly. To start off, I have decided to use mock

                          appropriatelty. Later, I will be using GET requests to

                <h2 id="line4_4">Integrating with Backend</h2>
                <p>
                  As our main components have been developed, I now moved onto
                  creating model components to define requests and responses
                  that will be sent to the backend API endpoints.
                </p>
                <p>Here is an exmple of create chat request:</p>
                <pre class="brush: js">
                  public async createGroupChat(
                      initiator: string,
                      participants: string[],
                      chatName: string
                  ): Promise {string} {
                      const requestBody = {
                          initiator: initiator,
                          chat_name: chatName,
                          participants: participants,
                          is_group: true,
                      }};
                  </pre
                >
                <p>
                  I have also defined controller components that will be sending
                  the actual requests to to the backend endpoins. The controller
                  then uses the model to process the data and communicates this
                  with the view components so that the data can be displayed
                  accordingly:
                </p>

                <pre class="brush: js">
                    try {
                      const response = await fetch(`${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL}create-chat`, {
                          method: "POST",
                          headers: {
                              "Content-Type": "application/json",
                          },
                          body: JSON.stringify(requestBody),
                      });
          
                      if (!response.ok) {
                          throw new Error("Failed to create chat");
                      }
                      const responseData = await response.json();
                    }
                  </pre
                >

                <p>
                  In the view components, such as the chat modal component, we
                  can simply call the function from chat controller to trigger
                  the API call. Here we pass in the data when sending requests:
                </p>

                <pre class="brush: js">
                    const handleCreateChat = async () => {
                      if (!chatName || selectedParticipants.length === 0) return;
                      try {
                          const chatId = await createGroupChat("John Doe", selectedParticipants, chatName);
                          if (onCreateChat) {
                              onCreateChat(chatId, selectedParticipants);
                          }

                <p>
                  For testing these components, we as a group decided to use
                  Vitest. Vitest is fast and efficient, using Vite's build
                  system for quick test runs. It works well with modern tools
                  like TypeScript and JSX. With simple APIs and built-in
                  features like mocking, it makes testing easier and faster.
                </p>

                <h3>Purpose of Testing UI Components</h3>
                <p>
                  Testing UI components is important because it ensures that the
                  user interface works as expected, providing a smooth and
                  bug-free experience for users. It helps catch issues early,
                  preventing them from affecting the overall functionality or
                  user satisfaction. Additionally, UI testing ensures that
                  changes or new features don’t unintentionally break existing
                  parts of the application, maintaining consistency and
                  reliability.
                </p>

                <h3>Component Testing</h3>
                <p>
                  For testing our componets, I first drafted out all the
                  possible scenarios I could cover int he test cases, by
                  carefully examining each component. This helped make sure the
                  tests provided a good overall coverage and made our components
                  more robust
                </p>

                <p>Here are some of the test cases:</p>
                <pre class="brush: js">

                      });

              <p>
                After deciding that we'd use MongoDB for our database
                operations, we got started by exploring the UI and some of the
                documentation that Mongo has laid out. Initially, we set up two
                databases—one for development, and one for production.
              </p>
              <a href="images/upload/mongo.png" data-rel="prettyPhoto"
                ><img
                  src="images/upload/mongo.png"
                  alt=""
                  class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"
              /></a>
              <p>
                At first, we had difficulty connecting with this online
                instance. We had successfully established a connection, were
                able to create tables and insert entries into these tables, but
                we realised that this was only on a local instance. We quickly
                changed our connection string to reflect that of the online
                instance, by using the command:
              </p>
              <pre class="brush: bash">
mongosh "mongodb+srv://{username}:{password}@whispercluster.e03b9.mongodb.net/dev?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=WhisperCluster"
              </pre>
              <p>
                This command would connect us to the online instance and allow
                us to propogate our requests externally.
              </p>
              <h4 id="line6_2">UserManager</h4>
              <p>
                The MongoUserManager class is where the PyMongo helper methods
                are defined. When the server starts up, only one instance of
                MongoUserManager will be created (when the app settings are
                defined), which is much more memory efficient than creating a
                new object for each incoming request.
              </p>
              <p>
                These requests are then handled by the endpoints defined, and
                use the helper functions to receive outputs on the request data,
                where the request data is parsed in as arguments.
              </p>
              <p>
                Below is an example of how our register user endpoint uses the
                register user method in MongoUserManager to execute the
                necessary database operations:
              </p>
              <pre class="brush: python">
@app.post("/register")
async def register(request: models.RegisterRequest):
    try:
        # Validate input
        if not request.username or not request.password:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=400, detail="Username and password are required"
            )

        # attempting to register user
        response = config.user_manager.register_user(request.username, request.password)
        if response:
            config.logger.info("User registered successfully")
            return {"message": "User registered successfully"}
        (...)
              </pre>
              <p>
                This method will get the user details from the request and use
                the register_user method in the MongoUserManager class to
                execute the database logic and return the result. This
                particular method returns a boolean, indicating whether the user
                registration was successful or not:
              </p>
              <pre class="brush: python">
def register_user(self, username: str, password: str) -> bool:
    user_exists = self.users_collection.find_one({"username": username})

    if user_exists:
        return False

    hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode("utf-8"), bcrypt.gensalt())

    user_document = {
        "username": username,
        "password": hashed_password,
        "created_at": time.time(),
    }
    self.users_collection.insert_one(user_document)
    self.config.logger.info("\nUser added to DB")
    return True
              </pre>
              <br />
              <h4 id="line6_3">Endpoints</h4>
              <p>
                The pymongo API logic had now been written, and the next step
                was writing request handlers that would operate on this logic.
                Here is an example of one of the endpoints we have for logging
                in:
              </p>
              <pre class="brush: python">
@app.post("/login")
async def login(request: models.LoginRequest):
    """User login endpoint."""
    try:
        # Validate credentials
        if config.user_manager.validate_user(request.username, request.password):
            # Generate and return login token
            token = config.user_manager.generate_token(request.username)
            return {"token": token, "username": request.username}
        else:
            raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Invalid credentials")
    except Exception as e:
        config.logger.error(f"Login error: {e}")
        raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail="Login failed")
              </pre>
              <p>
                This endpoint will take the LoginRequest pydantic model that
                we've defined as a parameter, use the helper functions defined
                in the UserManager class to validate that the user's credentials
                can be registered, generate a web token associated with the user
                and return it in the response.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's worth noting that we have also written comprehensive
                documentation on each endpoint, including how to call it, what
                it's expecting in the request body, and what it returns. This
                documentation takes the form of a README.md file in our backend

                  <p>
                    Our chat application is built on a microservices
                    architecture with two main services: whisper-client
                    (frontend) and whisper-core (backend). The whisper-client
                    handles all user interface components and WebSocket
                    connections, while whisper-core manages data persistence and
                    REST API endpoints.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The frontend (whisper-client) communicates with whisper-core
                    via REST API endpoints for operations that require data
                    persistence, such as user authentication, creating chats,
                    and storing messages.

                  <h4>WebSocket Implementation in whisper-client</h4>
                  <p>
                    Unlike traditional architectures, our WebSocket
                    implementation resides in the whisper-client microservice
                    rather than the backend. This design choice allows for more
                    responsive real-time updates and reduces load on the core
                    backend services.

                  <h4>Benefits of Client-side WebSocket Architecture</h4>
                  <p>
                    By implementing WebSockets in the whisper-client service
                    rather than whisper-core, we gain several advantages:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Reduced load on the core backend service</li>
                    <li>Lower latency for real-time message delivery</li>
                    <li>
                      Simplified scaling for the WebSocket service independently
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Clearer separation of concerns between persistence (REST
                      API) and real-time communication
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <div class="intro2 clearfix">

                      WebSockets implemented in the client service, we maintain
                      security by requiring token authentication for all
                      connections. The microservices architecture allows each
                      component to be scaled independently based on its specific

                For the backend, we created focused unit tests, using pytest,
                around the <strong>MongoUserManager</strong> class, which
                handles database interactions such as user creation, chat
                management, and message storage. These tests mock MongoDB
                responses to validate logic without needing a real database
                connection.

              <p>
                On the frontend, we used
                <strong>TypeScript unit tests</strong> to validate UI
                components, input validation, and utility functions. These tests
                help catch logic issues early and ensure consistent rendering
                and behavior in the React-based Whisper Client interface.
              </p>

              <h4 id="line8_2">Database Testing</h4>
              <p>
                Now that the database had been set up and the request handlers
                for communicating to the database had been committed, it was
                time to start sending test requests to these endpoints.
              </p>
              <p>
                In order to this, we had two options. We could run copy and
                paste the localhost URL into the browser and add the endpoint we
                wanted to hit onto the end, but this wouldn't work for any
                request that required a request body or request header. To solve
                this, we used Postman, where we could customise the request
                type, body, and headers.
              </p>
              <a href="images/upload/postman.png" data-rel="prettyPhoto"
                ><img
                  src="images/upload/postman.png"
                  alt=""
                  class="img-responsive img-thumbnail"
              /></a>
              <p>
                By being able to add custom headers to each request, this would
                allow us to authenticate necessary requests with a custom
                Whisper API key so that users couldn't make unauthenticated
                requets. For our automated end-to-end tests, please see

              <p>
                Our <strong>end-to-end (E2E) tests</strong> simulate real user
                interactions and validate the system as a whole. Written in
                Python using <strong>pytest</strong>, these tests interact with
                live API endpoints, ensuring that requests and responses
                interact correctly with the MongoDB database.
              </p>

              <p>
                Each E2E test covers scenarios like chat creation, user login,
                message sending, and permission validation. These tests help
                verify integration between components and provide high
                confidence that the endpoints behave correctly in
                production-like environments.

              <p>
                To ensure the stability and reliability of our application,
                we’ve set up both unit and end-to-end test suites. You can run
                them locally using the following commands:
              </p>

              <h5>🧪 Backend Unit Tests (Python)</h5>
              <pre><code>pytest tests/unit_tests</code></pre>

              <h5>🚀 End-to-End Tests (Python)</h5>
              <pre><code>pytest tests/end_to_end_tests</code></pre>

              <h5>🧩 Frontend Unit Tests (TypeScript)</h5>
              <pre><code>npm run test</code></pre>

              <h5>Testing in VSCode</h5>
              <p>
                VSCode and potentially other IDEs allow you to seamlessly run
                all your tests. Use the 'Testing' button to run all the tests,
                like the example below.
              </p>

              <p>
                Make sure you have all necessary dependencies installed and any
                required services (like MongoDB) running if applicable. Running
                the full suite regularly helps catch regressions early and
                ensures all features continue to work as expected.

              <h4 id="line9_1">Dockerisation</h4>
              <p>
                We decided that we would deploy our application through building
                an image, and deploying containers using that image. We would
                use Docker for this, as it was relatively straightforward to use
                and would integrate with AWS easily.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first step was creating a Dockerfile that we could run with
                Docker to build an image of our application. We decided to use a
                lightweight Python base image so that build times would be
                minimised. As we didn't need the extra features, this would
                decrease our build time by about 80% from 50 seconds to ~10
                seconds whilst maintaining all the functionality that we needed.
              </p>
              <pre class="brush: bash">
FROM python:3.13-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY . /app

RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

CMD ["uvicorn", "app:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
              </pre>
              <p>
                The next task was to construct a .yml file that would build and
                deploy our containers. We created two services; one for our
                FastAPI application, and one for our Mongo instance. We set it
                up so that our FastAPI container would depend on the container
                hosting Mongo, so that if container two was down, container one
                would no longer try and operate as normal, as this would cause
                connection issues with the database.
              </p>
              <h4 id="line9_2">Pushing to ECR</h4>
              <p>
                After a commit, if you want your changes to be reflected in your
                production service, you must rebuild your Docker image and push
                it to AWS ECR. You can do both these things by running the
                following command:
              </p>
              <pre class="brush: bash">
docker buildx build \
--platform linux/amd64 \
-t 374544621977.dkr.ecr.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/whisper/core:latest \
--push .
              </pre>
              This will tell Docker to rebuild your image with the latest
              changes - because we are using a lightweight Python base image,
              this only took a few seconds. After the image has rebuilt itself
              to reflect the latest changes, it will push this image to ECR,
              which means that AWS has now been successfully updated to use the
              newest version of your application.
              <h4 id="line9_3">Deploying to ECS</h4>
              <p>
                The final step in the deployment process is spinning up new
                containers that are using the image hosting the updated version
                of our application. This is a simple case of taking down the
                previous containers and reloading them. This causes them to
                automatically use the updated version of the image, and is a
                task that can be done in the AWS UI.
              </p>

                This short guide will walk you through the process of deploying
                your React application to AWS using ECS (Elastic Container
                Service) and ECR (Elastic Container Registry). ECR is where you
                push your images, and ECS is the service that runs containers
                based on the images that are in ECR.

                  This is setting out the instructions for what Docker should do
                  when it receives a request to construct your application into

                Although we haven't quite finished our deployment process yet,
                we have clearly defined tasks that need to be complete before
                the newly-built image is pushed to Amazon ECR.

              <p>
                Our GitHub actions pipeline is configured to run the initial
                tests that we've layed out using Pytest, and then if those tests
                pass, the pipeline will log into AWS using an automated IAM
                role, push our image to ECR, and finally deploy our containers
                on ECS.
